Truth machine, ~ sends out initial light, N takes numerical input. If N takes in a 0, the light will dim and not move on,
if N takes in a 1, it will move on to R, re-intensify, and be reflected down into the loop:
>1nR\
\   /
the loop first sets intensity to 1, then does a numerical output, and then re-intensifies the light so that it can be
reflected around the mirrors and start the loop again.

(to be technical, the light actually does move on to R, where it has the value of 0, and thus does not participate in
the post-tick, where R executes, the program ~Nn (start, numerical in, numerical out) would indeed produce 0 for an input
of 0, since n operates in the tick, not the post-tick).
