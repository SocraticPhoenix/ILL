Truth machine (explanation of fancy tick & post-tick execution babble not included, but this program does rely heavily
on these mechanics...).

~ : emits light horizontally at the start of a program.
N : takes numerical input, set light intensity to the input.
n : produces numerical output. If the light has an intensity of 0 here, it will dim after n outputs and not move on.
R : re-intensify, if the light made it here, it can now continue into the loop.
> : double/splitting mirror, allows the light from the above / mirror to enter the loop and move right.
1 : set intensity to 1.
n : numerical output.
R : re-intensify.

the remaining \, /, and \ reflect the light back to > where it can start the loop again
